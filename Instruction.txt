Context â€“ Housing Price Prediction

Housing is one of the most fundamental human needs, alongside essentials like food and water. As living standards have improved over the years, the demand for housing has grown significantly. Beyond its role as shelter, the housing market also influences a country's economy and can directly impact its currency value.

A homeâ€™s sale price depends on many factors, such as:

    The propertyâ€™s size and location

    Building materials and construction quality

    The age of the house

    The number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and garages

Given all these variables, predicting housing prices accurately can offer major benefits to homebuyers, real estate investors, and developers. A good prediction model helps buyers understand the current market value of properties and guides them to make informed decisions based on their budgets and preferences.
ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The aim of this project is to predict housing prices in a town or suburb using the provided data on housing and locality features.
We will:

    Explore and preprocess the dataset

    Identify key features that most influence house prices

    Use Linear Regression to build a predictive model

    Evaluate its performance on unseen data
